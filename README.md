Hey there 👋

I’m Brodie, also known as Toasted, a self-taught web developer and aspiring Cybersecurity SOC Analyst from London, United Kingdom.

I primarily work on frontend development, using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, with experience in UI design using Figma and Photoshop.

This is a fresh profile where I’ll be sharing smaller projects, experiments, and works in progress, many of which are aimed at helping me build practical skills in cybersecurity alongside web development.
